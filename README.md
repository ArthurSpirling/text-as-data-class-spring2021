# Text as Data Class for Spring 2021
This repo contains lectures and "flipped session" materials from my NYU DS "Text as Data" course from spring 2021.  You will also find a syllabus.  

If you need the underlying .tex files, images, animations etc and you are an educator, drop me a line: I will do my best to get those to you.
