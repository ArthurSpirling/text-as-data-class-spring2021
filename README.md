# Text as Data Class for Spring 2021
This repo contains materials from my NYU DS "Text as Data" course from spring 2021.  You will also find a syllabus.  The course is updated from the one I taught previously---in particular, there is now more content on deep learning representations, including word embeddings.  I will leave my [2018 repo](https://github.com/ArthurSpirling/Text-as-Data-Class-Spring-2018-) up for now, though.

The lectures are split into two types: 
- **"pre-recorded" content**: these slides were the backdrop for my weekly (uploaded) videos that students watched before coming to class.  These are "core" teaching, and don't require any audience input.
- **"flipped" classroom sessions**: these were taught interactively with the students, once a week.  They include material recap, quizzes, questions, problems, technical extensions, discussion of applications etc.  

If you need the underlying .tex files, images, animations etc and you are an educator, drop me a line: I will do my best to get those to you.
