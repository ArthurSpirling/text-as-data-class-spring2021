# Text as Data Class for Spring 2021
This repo contains lectures and "flipped session" materials from my NYU DS "Text as Data" course from spring 2021.  You will also find a syllabus.  The course is updated from the one I taught previously---in particular, there is now more content on deep learning representations, including words embeddings.  I will leave my [2018 repo](https://github.com/ArthurSpirling/Text-as-Data-Class-Spring-2018-) up for now, though.

If you need the underlying .tex files, images, animations etc and you are an educator, drop me a line: I will do my best to get those to you.
